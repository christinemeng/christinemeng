**Hello!** And welcome to my Github profile. 
I have some experience with Matplotlib and the basics of Python. 
I hope to take this class because I believe that in the future, Computer Science will be a very useful tool, no matter what career! 
Some of my goals include:
  1. Expanding my knowledge of python
  2. Building a simple game 
  3. Gaining a better understanding of what code can do
